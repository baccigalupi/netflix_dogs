    <bio>&lt;![CDATA[Always  the performer, Pen&#233;lope Cruz (born April 28,  1974, in Madrid, Spain) began
re-enacting TV commercials when she was a toddler  and studied classical ballet during her youth.
Her big break, however, came at  age 15 when she beat out hundreds of girls at a talent agency
audition.&amp;NFp;Cruz captured audiences' attention with her roles  in 1992's Jamon, Jamon and
Belle Epoque (which received an Oscar nod for Best  Foreign Film). In 1999, her work with director
Pedro Almodovar on the Best  Foreign Film Oscar winner All About My Mother brought her first
international  recognition.&amp;NFp;Fluent in Spanish, Italian,  French and English, Cruz
continues to work in American and international  productions, appearing in such films as
All the Pretty Horses (2000) and  Vanilla Sky (a remake of Eduardo Noriega's Open Your Eyes,
in which she also  starred). Her turn in Almodovar's Volver (2006) gained her an Oscar nod.]]&gt;</bio>
